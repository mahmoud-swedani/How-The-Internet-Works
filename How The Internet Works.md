whenever most people think, of the Internet this is what comes to, mind the Internet is not a bubble cloud, even in the new age of cloud computing,
the whole fuzzy cloud picture was, created by people more concerned about, job security than education this is the, internet the Internet is a wire actually,
buried in the ground it might be fiber, optics copper or occasionally beamed to, satellites or through cell phone, networks but the Internet is simply a,
wire the Internet is useful because two, computers connected directly to this, wire can communicate a server is a, special computer connected directly to
the Internet and web pages are files on, that servers hard drive every server has, a unique Internet Protocol address or IP
address just like a postal address IP, addresses help computers find each other, but since seven 2.14 205 done 100 it, doesn't exactly roll off the tongue we, 
also give them names like google.com, facebook.com or security catalyst comm, so this is how it works, your computer at home is not a server, 
because it's not connected directly to, the Internet computers you and I use, everyday are called clients because, they're connected indirectly to the, 
Internet through an Internet service, provider here we'll pretend that this is, my home laptop and I'm using DSL now, let's pretend that I want to visit, 
aol.com which is coincidentally both a, server and an ISP I hop onto my laptop, with DSL go through my ISP onto the, internet and look at aol.com my computer, 
connects with AOL comm and I can look at, its web pages now let's say that I want, to send an email to, and Ruth and Ruth has AOL dial-up from, 
home and I've got a gmail account I log, on to gmail.com and compose a message to, Aunt Ruth's email address Aunt Ruth's at, aol.com
once I click send gmail.com since the, email to Al well calm the next day Aunt, Ruth dials into AOL servers and, retrieves the email whenever an email
picture or webpage travels across the, internet computers break the information, into smaller pieces called packets when
information reaches its destination the, packets are reassembled in their, original order to make a picture email
web page or tweet, okay so imagine you're at work sitting, next to your boss and you're both
surfing online your boss is doing market, research and you're updating your, Facebook profile you're both sending
packets back and forth over the Internet, but what's to keep your packets from, accidentally ending up on your boss's
screen that could be embarrassing the, solution to that problem is IP addresses, and routers everything connected
directly or indirectly to the Internet, has an IP address everything that, includes your computer servers cell
phones and all of the equipment in, between anywhere two or more parts of, the internet intersect there's a piece
of equipment called a router routers, direct your packets around the internet, helping each packet get one step closer
to its destination every time you visit, a website upwards of ten to fifteen, routers may help your packets find their
way to and from your computer imagine, each packet as a piece of candy wrapped, in several layers the first layer is
your computer's IP address your computer, sends the packet to the first router, which adds its own IP address each time
the packet reaches a new router another, layer is added until it reaches the, server then when the server sends back,
information, it creates packets with an identical, wrapping as the packet makes its way
over the internet back to your computer, each router unwraps a layer to discover, where to send the packet next until it,
reaches your computer and not your, bosses and that's how the internet works, in five minutes or less and you're now, 
easily in the top 10 percent of people, who understand the basics of the, Internet if you found this video helpful,
